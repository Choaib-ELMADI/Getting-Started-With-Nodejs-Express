1. What is Node.js?
                =
                =
====================================================================
=                                                                  =
=                                                                  = 
Front-end(Browser)                                                 Back-end(Server)
JavaScript is normally confined to run                             Node allows us to run JavaScript on the server side
in a browser in the past on the frontend                           as well or even directly on computers.
(add interactivity to a web page).

We can't directly run JavaScript on a computer, but it can run inside a browser, So how does that work?
Running inside browsers is an engine called V8 engine (C++ by Google) and it compiles JavaScript into
machine code at runtime.

Node.js is a program also written in C++ and that wraps the V8 engine.
Node is more than V8 (adds more feature to JavaScript):
    *) Read & Write files on a computer
    *) Conect to a database
    *) Act as a server for content

2. Node basics:
    => global object: 
        It's like the window object in the browser.

    => import:
        To import something, we use require('./relative__path')
        When we require a file, we run it
        We dont have access to what we require, until we export it
        To export something, we use module.exports = { ... }

    => file system:
        *) readFile:
            - is an async fct
            - it takes the relative file path and a callback fct that returns a buffer

        *) writeFile:
            - is an async fct
            - it takes the relative file path, data to write and a callback fct

        *) unlink: (Delete file)
            - is an async fct
            - it takes the relative file path and a callback fct

        *) mkdir / rmdir:
            - is an async fct
            - it takes the relative folder path and a callback fct
