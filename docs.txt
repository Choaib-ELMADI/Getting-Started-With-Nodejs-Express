1. What is Node.js?
                =
                =

=                                                                  =
=                                                                  = 
Front-end(Browser)                                                 Back-end(Server)
JavaScript is normally confined to run                             Node allows us to run JavaScript on the server side
in a browser in the past on the frontend                           as well or even directly on computers.
(add interactivity to a web page).

We can't directly run JavaScript on a computer, but it can run inside a browser, So how does that work?
Running inside browsers is an engine called V8 engine (C++ by Google) and it compiles JavaScript into
machine code at runtime.

Node.js is a program also written in C++ and that wraps the V8 engine.
Node is more than V8 (adds more feature to JavaScript):
    *) Read & Write files on a computer
    *) Conect to a database
    *) Act as a server for content

2. The global object:
    global => It's like the window object in the browser
